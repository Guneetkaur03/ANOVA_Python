# ANOVA_Python
Analysis of Variance 

>Analysis of variance helps us to know whether the results of survey or experiment are sigificant.
>They are used for either of two:
- reject null hypothesis
- accept the alternate hypothesis

Basically, you’re testing groups to see if there’s a difference between them. Examples of when you might want to test different groups:
-A group of psychiatric patients are trying three different therapies: counseling, medication and biofeedback. You want to see if one therapy is better than the others.
-A manufacturer has two different processes to make light bulbs. They want to know if one process is better than the other.
-Students from different colleges take the same exam. You want to see if one college outperforms the other.

> ANOVA can be 'one-way' or 'Two-Way'. If only one independent variable is considered, then its one-way else two-way.
